# beaver-module
beaver builder theme modules is a plugin that I created to extend the capability of free beaver builder module lite


MODULES LOCATION:

Under the modules > theme folder you can view a lots of modules that you can reuse to any of your wordpress projects like carousel
of course we can create fresh modules, this kind of modules is easy to maintain and debug by other programmer because the files is easy to locate, the name  of modules in frontend is the name of modules folder.


MODULES CODE STYLE:

It is Object Oriented Implementation to make it for organize and easy to understand I created different files and folder.

1. modules folder
example:
  carousel (parent folder)
    css (child folder)
    includes (child folder)
    config file (php file)
    
2. css folder
example:
  frontend.css (the appearance of the module in your frontend so it easy to style or update the css of every module)
